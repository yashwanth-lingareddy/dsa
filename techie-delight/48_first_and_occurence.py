Given a sorted integer array, find the index of a given number's first and last occurrence.

Input: nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], target = 5
Output: (1, 3)
Explanation: The first and last occurrence of element 5 is located at index 1 and 3, respectively.

â€¢ If the target is not present in the array, the solution should return the pair (-1, -1).

Input: nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], target = 4
Output: (-1, -1)
