'''

Given an integer array, in-place rearrange it such that every second element becomes greater than its left and right elements.

â€¢ Assume that no duplicate elements are present in the input array.
â€¢ The solution should perform single traveral of the array.
â€¢ In case the multiple rearrangement exists, the solution can return any one of them.

Input : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Output: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6] or [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4], or any other valid combination..

Input : [6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 4]
Output: [6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 4] or [1, 5, 2, 6, 4, 9], or any other valid combination..
